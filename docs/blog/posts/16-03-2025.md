## Introduction

In the world of cybersecurity, **protecting applications and systems from their design phase** is crucial. With the increasing sophistication of attacks, the **Security by Design approach has become a necessity** for organizations. Within this strategy, threat modeling is a fundamental technique that allows identifying vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

In this article, we will explore two of the most effective models for analyzing and mitigating threats in real projects: STRIDE and PASTA. We will delve into their characteristics, operation and how they can contribute to information security from a **risk prevention and mitigation** perspective.

## What is Threat Modeling and why is it needed?

Threat modeling is a process to **identify possible attack vectors** against a system and **develop strategies to mitigate them**. Its goal is to detect security flaws from the design phase, avoiding costly fixes later.

This proactive approach allows evaluating risks from both an offensive and defensive perspective simultaneously, helping development and security teams **implement measures before problems occur**. Through threat modeling, organizations can identify critical assets, analyze attack vectors and apply appropriate controls, reducing the impact of potential vulnerabilities.

### Benefits of Threat Modeling

Threat modeling not only improves an organization's security posture but also provides significant operational, legal, and economic advantages:

- Risk reduction: Allows anticipating and correcting vulnerabilities before they are exploited, preventing security breaches and cyber attacks.

- Cost savings: Minimizes late repairs and reduces the frequency of security incidents, resulting in lower costs associated with damages and remediation.

- Regulatory compliance: Facilitates compliance with regulations and standards such as GDPR, ISO 27001, and NIST, ensuring systems meet security best practices.

- Improved software quality: Security is integrated from the initial development phase, avoiding critical issues in later stages of the software lifecycle.

- Easier decision making: Provides a systematic and documented approach to risk assessment, allowing organizations to allocate resources more efficiently and make informed security decisions.

## Threat Modeling Frameworks

There are various frameworks that adapt to different organizational contexts and needs:

- **Asset-based Frameworks**: Focus on identifying and protecting an organization's most valuable assets, such as sensitive data or critical systems.

- **Attacker-based Frameworks**: Analyze the motivations, capabilities, and methods of potential attackers to anticipate their movements.

- **Software-based Frameworks**: Specifically designed to detect vulnerabilities in applications during their development.

- **Risk-based Frameworks**: Evaluate threats according to their probability and potential impact on business objectives.

Among the most used frameworks in the industry are STRIDE and PASTA, each with their own unique strengths and approaches to addressing security from the early stages of development.

### STRIDE: Category-Based Threat Identification

Developed by Microsoft, STRIDE is a model that classifies threats into six categories, allowing security teams to **design specific defenses**. This structured approach helps **mitigate risks from the design phase** of software, improving security and reducing vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

STRIDE provides a systematic framework to analyze each system component for specific vulnerabilities. Below, each threat category and corresponding mitigation strategies are detailed:


- **Spoofing**: Occurs when an attacker impersonates another entity to gain unauthorized access. This can include falsification of user identities, services, or systems.
    - *Examples*: Phishing, cookie forgery, URL spoofing.
    - *Mitigation*: Implementation of multi-factor authentication (MFA), use of digital certificates, and robust identity management systems.


- **Tampering**: Refers to unauthorized modification of data, whether in transit or at rest.
    - *Examples*: Database data alteration, web form parameter modification, SQL injection.
    - *Mitigation*: Use of digital signatures, integrity control through hash functions, implementation of strict access controls and input validation.


- **Repudiation**: Occurs when a user denies having performed an action and there is no way to prove otherwise.
    - *Examples*: A user denying having made a fraudulent transaction or sent a malicious message.
    - *Mitigation*: Secure and signed audit logs, implementation of digital signatures for transactions, and immutable records using technologies like blockchain.


- **Information Disclosure**: Is the unauthorized exposure of sensitive information to individuals who should not have access to it.
    - *Examples*: Personal data leaks, exposure of internal configurations, or display of detailed errors.
    - *Mitigation*: Encryption of data in transit and at rest, implementation of the principle of least privilege, and sanitization of user-visible errors.


- **Denial of Service**: Attacks designed to make a system or application inaccessible to its legitimate users.
    - *Examples*: HTTP request flooding, server resource exhaustion, or distributed DDoS attacks.
    - *Mitigation*: Implementation of firewalls and DDoS mitigation systems, request rate limiting, and design of scalable and redundant architectures.


- **Elevation of Privilege**: Occurs when a user obtains access levels higher than those assigned.
    - *Examples*: Operating system vulnerability exploitation, command injection, or buffer overflow.
    - *Mitigation*: Application of the principle of least privilege, system segmentation, regular security updates, and rigorous input validation.


#### Practical Applications of STRIDE

The STRIDE model is widely used in the cybersecurity industry due to its clear focus on threat classification and the ease with which it can be integrated into secure development processes. It is especially useful in:

- Secure API Design: Helps identify and mitigate risks in service-to-service communication.

- Database Protection: Helps implement measures to prevent sensitive data manipulation and disclosure.

- Secure Web and Mobile Application Architectures: Facilitates the creation of more robust systems against attacks.

#### Recommended Tools for Threat Modeling with STRIDE

To facilitate the implementation of the STRIDE model, specialized tools can be used that automate threat identification and mitigation strategy generation:

- [Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/develop/threat-modeling-tool){:target="_blank"}: An official Microsoft tool designed to help developers identify and mitigate security threats in their applications.

- [Threatspec](https://threatspec.org/): A tool that facilitates threat modeling automation, allowing its integration into agile development and DevOps.

The use of STRIDE in combination with these tools enables more efficient vulnerability detection and better system protection from the initial phase.

### PASTA: A Risk-Based Approach

PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis) is a more detailed model based on risk analysis and attack simulation. Unlike STRIDE, which focuses on threat categorization, PASTA provides a holistic approach, **evaluating threats based on potential business impact**.

The 7 Phases of PASTA are:

1. Goal Definition: Assessment of security requirements and business-specific threats.

2. Intelligence Gathering: Environment analysis, identification of malicious actors, and collection of data on previous attacks.

3. System Architecture Modeling: Detailed evaluation of infrastructure, software, and system dependencies.

4. Vulnerability Analysis: Identification of weaknesses using security scanning tools and penetration testing.

5. Attack Analysis: Simulation of potential attacks to assess how detected vulnerabilities could be exploited.

6. Mitigation Strategy: Development of response and remediation plans based on findings.

7. Monitoring and Continuous Improvement: Implementation of controls for early threat detection and defense updates.

#### Practical Applications of PASTA

PASTA is particularly useful in business environments where cybersecurity strategies need to be aligned with business and regulatory objectives. Its risk-based approach allows **prioritizing efforts and resources** on the most critical threats.

Some of its most common applications include:

- Critical Infrastructure Protection: Companies handling sensitive data can use PASTA to strengthen their systems against advanced threats.

- Regulatory Compliance: Helps comply with regulations like GDPR, ISO 27001, and NIST by providing a detailed risk-based security framework.

- Security in DevOps Environments: Its integration with agile methodologies allows identifying risks and applying solutions without affecting development speed.

#### Recommended Tools for Threat Modeling with PASTA
