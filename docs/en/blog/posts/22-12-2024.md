# New EU Cyber Resilience Act

On October 23, 2024, the **European Cyber Resilience Regulation** came into force, marking a regulatory shift aimed at strengthening digital security across the European Union. At **Atlansec**, this milestone reinforces our core mission: **to create solutions and digital products that are secure throughout their lifecycle and ensure the protection of the environments in which they operate.**

## What does this regulation entail?

The new regulatory framework establishes clear and unified requirements to ensure cybersecurity in the design, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of digital products. Its goal is to close existing security gaps and provide consumers and businesses with the confidence that the products they purchase are designed to be secure against current and future threats.

### **Key Objectives of the Regulation**

- **Cybersecurity standards across Europe:**
  These apply to all connected products, whether directly or indirectly linked to networks or devices, avoiding overlaps between legislations in different Member States.
- **Security throughout the lifecycle:**
  Manufacturers must implement vulnerability management processes, conduct risk assessments, and issue declarations of conformity.
- **Greater transparency for consumers:**
  Facilitating the identification of secure products, helping users make informed decisions when purchasing hardware or software.
- **Shared responsibility across the value chain:**
  Manufacturers, importers, and distributors must ensure compliance with these measures, enhancing security at every stage—from design to end use.

### **Key Aspects of the New Regulation**

- **Comprehensive coverage:**
  All digital products are subject to the regulation, except those already governed by other standards (e.g., medical devices, aircraft, and automobiles).
- **Vulnerability management:**
  Manufacturers must ensure their digital products remain secure against new threats through timely updates.
- **Market surveillance framework:**
  Strengthened oversight to ensure compliance with these standards and safeguard end users.
