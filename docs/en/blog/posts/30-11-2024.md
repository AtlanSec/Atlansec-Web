# XVIII Jornadas STIC CCN-CERT | VI Jornadas de Ciberdefensa ESPDEF-CERT

Last Tuesday, we had the honor of attending the **<a href="https://jornadas.ccn-cert.cni.es/es/xviiijornadas" target="_blank">XVIII Jornadas STIC CCN-CERT | VI Jornadas de Ciberdefensa ESPDEF-CERT</a>**, held at the Kinépolis cinemas in Ciudad de la Imagen, Madrid. The main purpose of this trip was to receive an award granted to our cybersecurity team, who emerged as winners of a national competition organized by the Universidad de Granada in collaboration with the **<a href="https://youtu.be/w7iuEEjaLYU" target="_blank">El Mando Conjunto del Ciberespacio (MCCE)</a>** and the **<a href="https://www.incibe.es/" target="_blank">Instituto Nacional de Ciberseguridad (INCIBE)</a>**. This recognition not only fills us with pride but also reinforces our commitment to new generations and our confidence in the immense talent of these young professionals.

Moreover, we took advantage of our time at this important event to start carving out a space for ourselves in the industry, establishing connections with other companies, and learning from the experiences and advice of leading organizations in the technological landscape, both nationally and internationally.

We are convinced that this is the right path, and we are leaving Madrid with great enthusiasm to help all the companies that place their trust in us achieve excellence.
